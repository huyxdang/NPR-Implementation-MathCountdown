## üìã Pre-Submission Actions

### Before Sharing

1. **Clean up outputs:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf output/  # Remove any training outputs
   rm -rf __pycache__/ nsr_countdown/__pycache__/
   ```

2. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   python verify_installation.py
   ```

3. **Check imports work:**
   ```bash
   python -c "from nsr_countdown.config import TrainingConfig; print('‚úì Imports working')"
   ```

4. **Review documentation:**
   - [ ] Read README.md as if you're a new user
   - [ ] Check all links work
   - [ ] Ensure examples are clear
   - [ ] Verify API documentation is complete

5. **Test on clean environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv test_env
   source test_env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python verify_installation.py
   ```

### Optional Enhancements (If Time Permits)

- [ ] Add GitHub Actions CI/CD
- [ ] Add unit tests with pytest
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Add more example notebooks
- [ ] Add comparison with original implementation
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
